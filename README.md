# Operating-Systems
PCC - CIS 120
One function of operating systems is to monitor the performance of the device.  
This is done through a program that reports information on computer resources (CPU, Memory, Disk, Network, GPU...)
In windowsOS, a TaskManager is used.  Now that I require more of my device, I frequently use this monitoring program //
to assess how my resources are allocated.

Another funciton of operating systems is to configer a device.
This is done through a device drvier, essentially a software liasion between an OS and a device.
Device Drivers must be installed before a connected device can be used.

Operating systems have a huge impact on productivity through how they manage programs.
Single tasking operating systems only perform a single task.  
Many OS use STOS and are on embedded computers and some mobile devices.
