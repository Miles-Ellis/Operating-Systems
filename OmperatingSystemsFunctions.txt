One function of operating systems is to monitor the performance of the device.  
This is done through a program that reports information on computer resources (CPU, Memory, Disk, Network, GPU...)
In windowsOS, a TaskManager is used.  Now that I require more of my device, I frequently use this monitoring program //
to assess how my resources are allocated.
